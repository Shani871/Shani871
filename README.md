If you'd like this to be more stylish, I can:
- Add more visual badges (LinkedIn, email, website, tech stack badges).
- Add animated GitHub stats or a contribution calendar.
- Convert sections into collapsible details for a cleaner look.
- Tune colors/themes for your profile-stats cards.

How would you like it styled? If you want, tell me which badges or theme you'd like and I’ll update the README accordingly.
```
